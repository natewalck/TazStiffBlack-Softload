notes = Specialized fine-resolution settings optimized for generating smooth surfaces needed by high-precision optical mounts. Strongly recommend setting a 50um layer height across critical regions.\n\nCorrect hole sizes can be achieved with X/Y compensation at -0.15. Typically, -0.1 is used as a compromise. In some cases, especially when compensation has already been included in the model, compensation is set to 0.
